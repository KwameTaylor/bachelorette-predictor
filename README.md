# The Bachelorette Predictor
## Kwame V. Taylor

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts which contestant will win a given season of the ABC reality show The Bachelorette, based on data from Season 11 (train), Season 12 (validate), and Season 13 (test).

A note on transparency -- I have not seen any of the above selected seasons of the show. I have, however, seen Season 15 of The Bachelorette, and I am currently watching Season 16. I have left Season 14 out of the data for the sake of time effienciency, as I would have to scrape that data myself from the Bachelor Nation Wiki, since the FiveEightyThree data has not been updated past Season 13. I may include Season 14 in a future iteration.
