# The Bachelorette Predictor
### Kwame V. Taylor

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts how many weeks a contestant will last on the ABC reality show The Bachelorette, based on data from Seasons 1-2 and 4-12.

A note on transparency -- I have not seen any of the above selected seasons of the show. I have, however, seen Season 15 of The Bachelorette, and I am currently watching Season 16. <!--I have left Season 13 and 14 out of the data for the sake of time efficiency, as I would have to scrape that data myself from the Bachelor Nation Wiki, since the FiveThirtyEight data has not been updated past Season 13.--> I may include Seasons 3, 13, and 14 in a future iteration of this project.

**Warning: This project contains *many* spoilers for past seasons.** Proceed at your own risk.

## Background

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette):
> ***The Bachelorette*** is an American reality television dating game show that debuted on ABC on January 8, 2003. The show is a spin-off of The Bachelor and the staple part of The Bachelor franchise. The first season featured Trista Rehn, the runner-up from the first season of The Bachelor, offering the opportunity for Rehn to choose a [spouse] among 25 bachelors.

> All of the rules are adapted from the rules of The Bachelor‚Äîits parent show. As the name implies, the series revolves around a single bachelorette, usually a former contestant from the previous Bachelor season, and a pool of romantic interests [...] which could include a potential [spouse] for the bachelorette; it is essentially a gender-reversed version of the parent show. The show starts with the bachelorette standing in front of the mansion and greeting each contestant individually, as they make an entrance to the bachelorette. After each rose ceremony, at least one contestant does not receive a rose and goes home; therefore, the pool of contenders gets smaller, and eventually leaves the bachelorette to decide between two contestants in the final rose ceremony.

> For the final selection, one of two male suitors proposes to the bachelorette. Unlike its parent show, all fifteen seasons of The Bachelorette have ended with a proposal which the bachelorette either accepted or declined.

- Eliminates connote either an elimination (starts with "E") or a rose (starts with "R").
- Eliminations supercede roses.
- "E" connotes a standard elimination, typically at a rose ceremony. "EQ" means the contestant quits. "EF" means the contestant was fired by production. "ED" connotes a date elimination. "EU" connotes an unscheduled elimination, one that takes place at a time outside of a date or rose ceremony.
- "R" means the contestant received a rose. "R1" means the contestant got a first impression rose.
- "D1" means a one-on-one date, "D2" means a 2-on-1, "D3" means a 3-on-1 group date, and so on.
- Weeks of the show are deliminated by rose ceremonies, and may not line up exactly with episodes.

## Hypotheses

ùêª0: There is no linear correlation between a contestant's One-on-One Score and a contestant's Elimination Week.<br>

* Incorporate more of the existing data
* Create function to cache modified data
* Add feature: contestant's hometown's proximity to that season's bachelorette's hometown
* Add feature: Received a first impression rose
* In the future I'd like to analyze this as a time series, sampled by week and divided by season
* Go back to the joining of the two dataframes and recover the lost 18 observations (because of mismatched key pairs)
* Incorporate data from the Bachelor
* Join data about each contestant's corresponding bachelorette from their season, such as Age and HomeRegion
* Utilize clustering in feature engineering
* Deploy predictor as a software product
* Tune the hyperparameters of my Random Forest Regressor and use Grid-Search
* Use my best model to predict on the current season of The Bachelorette (I haven't seen past episode three yet :D)
* Add visual to my data dictionary for my engineered features
</details>

Instructions for use and reproduction:
## Main notebook
To see and read through the main notebook, you can navigate to ```bachelorette-predictor.ipynb``` in this GitHub repository.

You can explore the functions from the notebooks more concisely in the ```wrangle.py```, ```preprocessing.py```, ```explore.py```, and ```model.py``` files.

You can read about my thought process for this project more indepth, if you'd like, in the corresponding ```.ipynb``` files for ```wrangle```, ```preprocessing```, ```explore```, and ```model```.

## Setup

In order to run the code in this repository, you'll need to:

1. Have an installation of python through anaconda
2. Clone this repository
3. Copy or move the .csv files from ```kaggle-datasets/``` and ```kaggle-datasets/FiveThirtyEight/``` into the main repository folder
<!--3. An ```env.py``` file that defines the following variables:
  - 'user'
  - 'host'
  - 'password'-->

The code in here was developed on MacOS, but should run fine anywhere you can install python + anaconda.
