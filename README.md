# Bachelorette Prediction Project
## Kwame Taylor, Oct. 2020

This repository is where I will house my Bachelorette Prediction project.
This goal of this project is to use machine learning to create a model for accurately predicting which contestant will win a season of the Bachelorette, based on data that I will collect from the current season (S16) of the Bachelorette, including on-screen time per episode for each contestant.
